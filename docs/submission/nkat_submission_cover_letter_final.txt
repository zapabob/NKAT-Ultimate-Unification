Dear Editors,

Please find enclosed our manuscript "Complete Solution of Quantum Yang-Mills Theory via Noncommutative Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theory with Super-Convergence Factors", which addresses the Clay Millennium Problem of Yang-Mills mass gap existence. We provide:

(i) Constructive proof of mass gap existence: Δm = 0.010035 (Sec 3.2),
(ii) Complete mathematical framework with H³ Sobolev space rigor (Sec 3.1),
(iii) GPU-accelerated verification with 10⁻¹² precision (Sec 4),
(iv) Public data & code (Zenodo DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.15496874).

Given its combination of mathematical rigor addressing a Millennium Problem and computational verification, we believe it fits JHEP's scope perfectly.

We look forward to the referees' comments.

Sincerely,
