Dear Editors,

Please find enclosed our manuscript "Non-commutative Kolmogorov-Arnold
Representation Theory: A mathematically rigorous framework for
Beyond-SM physics", which addresses all technical points raised in the
previous internal review. We provide:

(i) 1- and 2-loop RG consistency (Sec 2.4, App A),
(ii) Full cosmological and EDM constraints (Secs 3.2, 3.3),
(iii) Public data & code (Zenodo DOI 10.5281/zenodo.xxxxx).

Given its combination of mathematical rigor and phenomenological
relevance, we believe it fits JHEP's scope.

We look forward to the referees' comments.

Sincerely,
NKAT Research Team (on behalf of the NKAT Collaboration)
